//    ESuspectBased - Ignores your set chance and does chancing based on suspect and vehicle data, (eg if the suspect is wanted, there's a much higher likelihood they'll shoot at you).
//        For more information on how Suspect data based chancing works, see https : //github.com/AstroBurgers/RiskierTrafficStops/blob/dev/docs/Chancing.md
//    ECompoundingChance - Starts at your default chance every time you go on duty and adds that number to the chance each traffic stop, resets when an RTS outcome happens.
