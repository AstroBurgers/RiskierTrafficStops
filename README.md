A LSPDFR plugin that adds randomized risk and tension to traffic stops by injecting unique suspect behaviors—ranging from verbal confrontation to outright violence.

## 🔧 Features

- Randomized traffic stop outcomes to keep encounters unpredictable
- Configurable via `.ini` and fully localizable via `.json`
- Developer-friendly API and public event hooks
- Supports sub-outcomes and mod extensibility

---

## Current Outcomes

- **Get Out and Shoot** – The suspect(s) exit and open fire on you and other officers.
- **Flee** – The suspect(s) flee either in their vehicle or on foot.
- **Yell** – The suspect exits the vehicle and verbally confronts you (3 sub-outcomes).
- **Ramming** – The suspect reverses into your patrol vehicle before fleeing.
- **Shoot and Flee** – The suspect fires from inside the vehicle, then flees.
- **Spit** – The suspect spits at you from inside their vehicle.
- **Get Out RO (Random Outcome)** – The suspect exits and reaches for something:
  - They may pull a **gun**, a **knife**, or just a **phone**.
  - Gun/knife outcomes each include 2–3 random behavioral variants.
